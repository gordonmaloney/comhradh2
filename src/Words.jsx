            <br />
            In this word, it’s the same as in the Scots <i>loch</i>, or the
            German <i>Bach</i>. And just remember that the stress in Gaelic is
            always on the first syllable: <i>BRÒnach</i>.

          <>
            The <i>ch</i> in this word is slightly further forward in the mouth
            than in <i>brònach</i>. In Gaelic, consonants can be affected by the
            vowels they’re next to, and this is an example of that.
            <br />
            <br />
            Vowels are split into two categories in Gaelic - ‘broad’ or ‘back’
            ones: AOU, and ‘slender’ or ‘front’ ones: IE. The <i>ch</i> in{" "}
            <i>brònach</i> is next to a broad vowel (a), so it’s further back in
            the mouth, and the <i>ch</i> in <i>toilichte</i> is next to a
            slender one (i), so it’s further forward.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have this same principle in English too - with words like{" "}
            <i>call</i> and <i>cell</i>. <br />
            <br />
            If you want to practice with these sounds,{" "}
